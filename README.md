# Image Classification with Deep Learning

## Description

This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow. The goal is to classify images into different categories using a dataset like CIFAR-10 or MNIST. The trained model is then deployed on a web application to demonstrate its performance.

## Skills Covered

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Computer Vision
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Deployment

## Project Structure

- `Colab_Notebook.ipynb`: Contains the code for training the CNN model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing results.
- `model_save.py`: Script to save the trained model (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python libraries required to run the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries**

   Install the necessary libraries by running:

   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

2. **Load and Preprocess Data**

   Use the provided Colab notebook to load and preprocess the dataset. The notebook contains code for handling CIFAR-10 or MNIST datasets.

3. **Build and Train the Model**

   Follow the instructions in the Colab notebook to build and train the CNN model. The notebook provides step-by-step code for creating and training the model.

4. **Evaluate the Model**

   Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the provided metrics. The notebook includes code to assess the model’s accuracy on the test dataset.

5. **Visualize Results**

   Visualize the results of the model predictions using the provided visualization code in the Colab notebook.

6. **Deploy the Model**

   For deployment, save the trained model using the `model_save.py` script and integrate it into a web application using Flask, Django, or another preferred framework.

## Example Code

Here’s a brief example of how to build and train a CNN model using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10

# Load and preprocess data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Build the CNN model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.1, verbose=1)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=2)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
```
